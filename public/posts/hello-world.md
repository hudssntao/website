# Hello World

This is my first blog post using markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

## Features

- **Bold Text**: You can make text bold.
- *Italic Text*: You can italicize text.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: You can strike through text.

## Code Samples

```javascript
function greeting() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Images

You can add images too! Like this:
